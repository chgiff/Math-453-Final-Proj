# Math-453-Final-Proj
Final project for Numerical Optimization Class

Implements various optimization techniques for comparison. Initially uses either the Nelder Mead or Partical Swarm optimization scheme 
to get close to the minimum then switches to either a conjugate gradient or quasi newton local optimization scheme for improved speed and
accuracy.
